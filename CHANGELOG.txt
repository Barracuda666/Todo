V4.0

Big update! -- this is the first part to a 2 parts mega update,
this one mainly including the new libraries and introducing the new interface,
and the next update will add major new systems with favorites, warnings, and descriptions on items.

------------------------

So, about this update, there is now:

- an entirely redesigned interface, that allows for a way clearer and intuitive experience,
as well as giving control over new customization options like opacity, and elements
that are only there if you need them, so that they don't take up too much place
in the frame for no reason.

- a brand new minimap button

- an entire options page in the wow's official AddOns interface panel,
which gives many options for controlling addon elements

- support for setting a key binding to toggle the frame! -> check in the addon options

- added profiles managment! so you can now for example use the same profile
as your other characters to share the same list and items

- added the DataBroker plugin --> you can now (that's one example) find and add
this addon in Titan Panel!

- added support for localization!
  -> there is currently support for enUS-enGB and frFr
  -> you can contribute for other languages in the localizations page on CurseForge

- bunch of bugs fixed (big update, so I may have created new ones, please tell me!)

----------------------

- as always, please do not hesitate to post comments if there are any bugs, or if you want to provide feedback!
